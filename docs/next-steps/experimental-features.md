# Experimental Features

If you see a feature on another Zooniverse project but you don’t see it as an option in the Project Builder, it may be an experimental feature we haven’t enabled for everyone yet. Most new Project Builder features are tested out as experimental features before we make them available as standard. If you see a feature that you think would be useful for your project, email us at [contact@zooniverse.org](mailto:contact@zooniverse.org) and ask for it to be enabled.
