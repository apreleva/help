# Newsletters

Did you know you can send a newsletter to your volunteers once your project is launched as an official Zooniverse project? Just send plain text copy to [contact@zooniverse.org](mailto:contact@zooniverse.org) and we will edit and send to your registered volunteers. 

Newsletters are one of the key ways of engaging with your community. Updates let volunteers know that their hard work is appreciated and being used by your research team. Newsletter will bring volunteers back to your project more than any other means of communication.
